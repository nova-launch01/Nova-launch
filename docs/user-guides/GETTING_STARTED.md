# Getting Started with Nova Launch

Welcome to Nova Launch! This guide will help you deploy your first token on the Stellar blockchain in minutes.

## What is Nova Launch?

Nova Launch is a no-code platform that lets you create custom tokens on the Stellar blockchain without writing any code. Whether you're a creator, entrepreneur, or business owner, you can launch your own token in just a few clicks.

## Why Use Nova Launch?

- **No Coding Required**: Simple form-based interface anyone can use
- **Ultra-Low Fees**: Deploy tokens for as little as 7 XLM (~$0.70)
- **Fast Deployment**: Your token is ready in seconds
- **Secure**: Non-custodial - you control your wallet and tokens
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Works on any device

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you'll need:

1. **A Stellar Wallet**: We recommend [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/) (see our [Wallet Setup Guide](WALLET_SETUP.md))
2. **XLM Tokens**: At least 10 XLM for deployment and fees
3. **A Web Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, or Brave (latest version)

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Get a Wallet

Install the Freighter wallet extension and create or import a wallet. See our detailed [Wallet Setup Guide](WALLET_SETUP.md).

### Step 2: Fund Your Wallet

You'll need XLM to pay for deployment fees:
- **Basic deployment**: 7 XLM
- **With metadata (logo/description)**: 10 XLM

**Where to get XLM:**
- Buy on exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, or Binance
- Use on-ramps like MoonPay or Ramp
- For testnet: Use the [Stellar Laboratory Friendbot](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator?network=test)

### Step 3: Connect to Nova Launch

1. Visit [Nova Launch](https://nova-launch.app)
2. Click "Connect Wallet" in the top right
3. Select your wallet (Freighter)
4. Approve the connection request
5. Choose your network (Testnet for testing, Mainnet for production)

### Step 4: Deploy Your Token

Follow our [Token Deployment Tutorial](TOKEN_DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions.

## What Happens After Deployment?

Once your token is deployed:

1. **Token Address**: You'll receive a unique contract address for your token
2. **Initial Supply**: Tokens are automatically minted to your wallet
3. **Transaction Record**: View your deployment in the transaction history
4. **Share Your Token**: Use the contract address to share with others
